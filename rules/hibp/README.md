# HCaptcha registration rule

## Description

Have I been pwned registration (HIBP) rule plugin uses HIBP API to check user's provided password for existence in
publicly available data dumps.

## Privacy policy addition

It is recommended to be transparent about HIBP usage in the site's privacy policyâ€”even for unauthenticated users.
HIBP plugin only submits the first five characters of the user's hashed password to fetch a range of possibly corrupted
password hashes. Then this list is locally compared to the full password hash to determine if it is included in past
data dumps. No clear-text password, complete password hash, or other user related data is sent to HIBP.
