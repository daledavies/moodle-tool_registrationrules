> ### hCaptcha
>
> We use the hCaptcha security service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition
> Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether user actions on our online
> service (such as submitting a login or contact form) meet our security requirements.
> To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics.
> This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app
> with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor
> has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be
> forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background.
> Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge.
> Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR: the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance
> of a contract to which the website visitor is party (for example, the website terms) or in order to take steps at the
> request of the website visitor prior to entering into a contract. Our online service (including our website,
> mobile apps, and any other apps or other forms of access offered by us) needs to ensure that it is interacting with
> a human, not a bot. And these activities performed by the user are not related to fraud or abuse. In addition,
> processing may also be based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR: our online service has a legitimate interest in protecting
> the service from abusive automated crawling, spam, and other forms of abuse that can harm our service or other users
> of our service. IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and
> a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
